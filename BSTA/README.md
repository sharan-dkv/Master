# Biostatistics

As a part of the BSTA 787 - Statistics for Genome analysis class, I had the opportunity to work on snp data and scRNA seq datasets as well. 

### HW - 1

This includes a small code to calculate the log of odds and recombination given the different theta functions
This also contains the code for a TDT test performed on SNP data obtained for autism. 

Plink was also used for doing some tests using this dataset

### HW - 2

This is an entire analysis of scRNA data using the scanPy package
