# Theoretical neuroscience

This is a collection of the models that I was able to build and work on as a part of the class BE 530 - Theoretical Neuroscience. 
The models include single neuron models, Hodgkin Huxley model, Izhikevich model and even modelling of the V1 cells in the retina

As a part of this course, I also had the opportunity to build Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow to model and perform image analysis on the MNSIT database.
